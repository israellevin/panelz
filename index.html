d: Medium shot of a model on a runway, from the point of view of the audiene below. She is wearing high heels, pink shorts, a pink tank÷ætop and a primitive looking fur coat. Most of her head is still above the frame.

d: The fur coat is dark brown and wild haired. Not your ordinary fashion show material. It bears a few odd markings in a lighter color.

c: Finally the show is over.
d: Full shot from behind - the model exiting the runway and trying to remove the coat.
A cross like mark on it is aligned perfectly with the lines of the wall and the floor, like one of those "depth" pictures that have to be viewed from a specific angle.
b t: The damn thing is stuck to me!
