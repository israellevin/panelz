d: Medium shot of a model on a runway, from the point of view of the audiene below. She is wearing high heels, pink shorts, a pink tank÷ætop and a primitive looking fur coat. Most of her head is still above the frame.

d: The fur coat is dark brown and wild haired. Not your ordinary fashion show material. It bears a few odd markings in a lighter color.

c: She can't really see much.
d: Model's point of view: cameras flashing from below.

c: And this damn coat is driving her mad.
d: Close-up on her hand, clenched in anger, her manicured fingernails burying into her palm.

c: Finally the show is over.
d: Full shot from behind - the model exiting the runway and trying to remove the coat.
A cross like mark on it is aligned perfectly with the lines of the wall and the floor, like one of those "depth" pictures that have to be viewed from a specific angle.
b t: The damn thing is stuck to me!

Can't get it off. Pushes a guy. Tries scissors - bleeds - heightened awareness.

Looks out window for refuge, sees a green hill in the distance, a path, finds herself walking it.

Flies. Sees the world from above. Sound of feathers. Feel of wings.

Murmuring behind the rattle of feathers. Calling her back.

]:0 1000
Wakes up in the arms of a weird woman.

Gives her herbed water.

]
Commotion around. Woman is out of sight.

Model follows.

six: I need to talk to you.
julia: Get in the car.
velcro: ...

Balcony. Scorch marks. No one followed. Picnic. Take a vacation. Falling asleep.

:Dream: the man. Breaking in. Mundane and magical defenced are neutralized. Board meeting. His magic contains theirs and the scorpion stings itself.

]
Morning. Kitchen.
six: Gonna get my stuff.
julia mental: Velcro - follow her.

]
Outside subway. Diseases Jap with a BAD sword. With the mark of the Children (three stripes) from the dream (write it there, lazy).

six bright: You should really put it down.

bleft: *ANGEL!*

]
Jap runs into station, slides to slice the phone lines.

Six, who just got her phone out to call Julia, gets no reception.

Magical gas seeps out the phone lines.

bleft: Now you die!

six: Go finger yourself till your eyes go round.

Hears Velcro from outside, runs to the tracks.

]
Along the tracks, up the tunnel.

]
...and into the open air (upper west, above ground) just in front of a coming train and up.
