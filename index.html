:Sweet. You just learned the most important thing about Panelz: hitting the space key. Try it again.

]
:See? Every time you hit space the story advances.

]
:And this time you did it all on your own.

]
:The right arrow works as well.

]
:And you'll never guess what the left arrow does.

]
:That's all I have for now. I suggest you use that left arrow to go back and check the samples at the beginning.

]
:Really, from here on it's just random tests that might, one day, turn into our test suite.
