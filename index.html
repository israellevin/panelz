The opening to the underworld. The camera is at the mouth of a cave. Within it are Persephone and Hades, facing each other in profile at the center of the frame. He is grabbing her for a kiss. She is crying. At the cameraman's feet there is a puddle in which dead leaves are floating. The couple are reflected in the water. Maybe, for to have less empty space, the frame will be tilted. Maybe a part of the original (not reflection) will be out of the frame. Maybe the pool and reflection will only appear in the panel. In any event - FIXME

Hades tearing Persephone's dress. It's his POV (maybe a bit higher), down his arm, from the bottom left corner, tearing at the center of the page. Her dress is living plants which shrivel and crumble under his touch.

Chunga chunga. POV is from behind Hades, at the base of the panel, with Persephone riding him. Suddenly it is she who is sinking him into the leaves (so you can't see his throbbing LoL at all, Aya), clawing at his broad shoulders. Flowers probably appear here and there.

Chunga chunga. POV is from above and a bit behind Persephone, who is sitting on Hades, facing him, arched back. With one hand he is holding her's behind her back, forcing her to arch, but also supporting her. With his other hand is grabbing her head and hair, arching her even further. He is biting at her breast. Pain and pleasure.

Second unit director says that maybe this picture should be upside down, like the hanging man which is the card of this comic.

Hades from behind, strangling Persephone while fucking her. Nearing death/orgasm.

A bird's soul entering the underworld. It starts with a bird, sort of metamorphs halfway to a plant (G is crazy) and becomes a ghostlike schmektekle yanked into the underworld. Refined. Quintessentialized.

Second unit director is not sure about this last image. Maybe the flowers should have been there all along. Maybe not at all.
