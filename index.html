d: A fashion model on a runway. She is wearing high heels, pink shorts, a pink tank÷ætop and a primitive looking fur coat.

d: The fur coat is dark brown and wild haired and bears odd markings in a lighter color. Hardly your ordinary fashion show material.

d: She can't really see much with all the cameras flashing

d: and the drugs are making it hard to think straight.

d: But it's becoming clear that she needs to quit this job.

d: In the hectic post-show backstage she is vigorously trying to remove the coat.

d: But there is no peace in this stillness. The world seems to be shouting sentences that will take years to complete, and the room is so stuffed of people and clothes and opinions...

d: Overwhelmed, she seeks refuge, looking almost automatically out the window.

d: The site of Manhattan during rush hour does little to alleviate the sensory overload, but then she sees a flicker of green between the towers.

d: A hill.

d: Trees.

d: A quiet path.

Commotion around. Woman is almost out of sight.

Six bleft: I need to talk to you.
Julia bright: Get in the car.
Velcro bright: ...

]
Balcony. Scorch marks. No one followed. Picnic. Take a vacation. Falling asleep.

d: Morning. Kitchen.
Six: Gonna get my stuff.
Julia mental: Velcro - follow her.

Outside subway. Diseases Japanese man with a BAD sword. With the mark of the Children (three stripes) from the dream (write it there, lazy).

Six bright: You should really put it down.

bleft: *ANGEL!*

]
The guy with the sword runs into station, slides to slice the phone lines.

Six, who just got her phone out to call Julia, gets no reception.

Magical gas seeps out the phone lines.

bright: Now you die!

Six bleft: Go finger yourself till your eyes turn round.

Hears Velcro from outside, runs to the tracks.

Along the tracks, up the tunnel.

Velcro, ruins, car (V keeps sword). Get stuff and go home.
Velcro: Julia is not on your side.

Bath scene. Self discovery with the TUSH. And Julia's tentacles going woosh woosh.

]
Tells Julia all (call Julia next time!), but refuses to give info about man.
She is an alien.
Agony, Children, Julia want to destroy the sword and profit - Hospitallers.

Velcro: I'm a scholar. Family. Not going to balls. Snobs. SHNAT SHERUT at Julia's.

]
Julia takes her to the meeting. Chair. Pentagram ALEK.

Six drifts.

]
Leonid enters, talks to Julia, Six sees his eyes shoot magic, but Julia is hidden by the Pentagram.

Leonid bright: Bla bla bla.
Six bleft: ...

]
She tries to listen, but he is boring, so she drifts again.

]
Makes Julia break the seal.

]
Tries to probe. Gets his balls grabbed.

]
Great embarrassment, Julia happy. But no parties.

]
Goes to sleep outdoors.

Velcro bright: Got beer. Julia is married. Also had a thing with Leonid. We don't talk much out of business.

Velcro bright: Nice to see a KOOSIT about.

Six bleft: Good night.

]
: Dream: Thelemans party. Man arrives, party favors, the General, brandy and cigars, show the bag, get reaction from thin Mason. Ha ha!

]
Morning. Burgers with Velcro at the mall.

]
d: back in the house

Velcro bleft: "Julia, you need to make a call"

Julia bright: "yep"

]
Julia talks to the mirror. Six sees Leonid getting out of sync with his magic. Julia speaks harshly  and then a bit gently. Leonid disintegrates.
Julia bright: A world war just started.

]
riding to safe house. Julia talks to ancestor. Velcro explains a bit about why he never thought to eavesdrop.

]
In the safe house Julia still out, Velcro casts protection spells from an old book. Six notice he is very stiff and minimalistic.

]
Six bleft: I don't mean to interfere, but you really should be more expressive.

Velcro brigh: Julia Told me to pay attention to all the weird stuff you say.

]
Velcro looks at the unconscious Julia, seeking approval, catches himself, gets annoyed with himself over it, tries again and does much better.

]
Six and Velcro watching TV and eating snacks when Julia opens her eyes.
Julia bright: The Children are right.

Velcro bleft:...

]
Six bleft: So now what?

Julia bright: Now we secretly get in touch with someone high in the children's hierarchy and convince him to work together.

Velcro bleft: Without getting killed

Julia bright: Naturally

Six bleft: You have any connections there?

Julia bright: Nope.

Six bleft: Any ideas?

Julia bright: Nope. You?

Six bleft: I could try to talk with my dream contact, see if he got some relevant info. He keeps tabs on them.

Julia bright: I'm not sure...

Six bleft: You got a better idea?

Julia bright: Fine. You do that. I'm off to bed.

]
: Dream: The tall man is weaving some magic in a naturally active location. He is building a scene.

Then off to the shadow, to wait for his prey.

]
Another man shows up.

The thin rat faced man from the Hospitallers party. The one that got spooked by the bag.

He is filled with delight. The place is luring, lively, inviting. It invokes his inner child, his sense of wonder.

d-invert: And like a creature of horror the tall man steps from the shadows.

]
d: The rat man tries to gain footage. To become more the wizard and less the child. He tries to inflate his self confidence.

d-invert: But the tall man pops it without effort, pulls a magical linchpin and the rat mans collapses, leaving the trap free....

]
to close on its real target. Her.

And Six can finally see his eyes are gray, as his gaze turn to her.

Six bright: Baby - you've noticed...

]
Andrew bright: Who are you?

Six bleft: I'm six.

Andrew bright: Who are you working for?

Six bleft: I work for no one.

Andrew bright: Why are you fallowing me?

Six bleft: I just dream about you - can't help it.

d: He frowns.

]
Six bleft: I'm sorry if it's not polite. I'm new to all this.

Andrew bright: New?

Six bleft: Few days, thats all.

Andrew bright: Hurm...

]
Six bright: So about the things you do -

Andrew bleft: What about them?

Six bright: Oh stop being like that! I'm sorry I dream about you - well actually not, I like watching you - but I didn't tell anyone about you.

Andrew bleft: And who is no one?

Six bright: Why did they send me? I'm just terrible with this sort of thing...

]
Six bright: Listen, since this thing happend to me I met some people, nice people, how are helping me to understend this thing that's happening to me.

Andrew bleft: Nice helpful people, yes I understend.

Six bright: I didn't tell them much about you, I've tried to keep your privacy...

Andrew bleft: Why?

Six bright: Coz I like you.

Andrew bleft: Hurm...

+Andrew: And you don't want to tell me who they are, do you?

Six bright: Noap.

Andrew bleft: Because you like them too.

Six bright: Yup.

]
Six bright: I need your help. Or at least I hoped I could use your help - So I'm really happy you caught me tonight.

Andrew bleft:...

Six bright: I got into trouble with the children.

+Six: They started it!

+Six: I was super nice and only tried to tell him he shouldn't be walking with that sword in his condition -

Andrew bleft: It was you who blew up the street.

Six bright: What?

+Six: No!

+Six: well yes but they deserved it. He tried to kill me and I was all sweetness.

Andrew bleft:...

Six bright: So we tried to make peace through the Hositallers, but

+Six: now

+Six: it seems they wont be able to pull it after all...

Six bright: And since I KNOW you know how to infiltrate them

+Six: I was hoping you could help me find a way to contact them and sort things out.

]
Andrew bright: And you're not gonna tell me who these people are.

Six bleft: I'd rather not.

Andrew bright:...

+Andrew: Fine. My name is Andrew Holmes. Tell your people they can contact me outside.

]
Six bright: Great. 10x a lot.

d: Andrew releases the trap.

Six bright: Its been a pleasure.
Andrew bleft:...

+Andrew: Yes.

+Andrew: (seems surprised).

+Andrew: It actually was.

d: And Six rises high and flies away

But she cant see them both yet.

They are ENORMOUS.

So she goes higher

And higher

Until she can see them both. Embraced in a fight.

The tail of the Leviathan, she notice, is a very different thing from the head.

And behind the squid and the Leviathan's parts there is something more.

]:100 -5000 0 3
She goes up higher and higher to see the Leviathan's trunk more clearly.

It's a huge brain like complex of thoughts and things.

It is clear to her how impossible this experience would be to those not as strong as her.

But she is just fine, so she stays a little and just watches this wonder.

gently.

]
In the morning she ravages the closet.

Unsurprisingly the safe house is much like the house - a random gathering place for furniture and knickknack.

She finds a lovely retro dress and accessorizes accordingly.

The hire takes almost an hour.

]
In the kitchen. Velcro is extremely pleased with her outfit.

Velcro bright: Morning.
+Velcro: Breakfast for m'lady?
+Velcro: Tee?
+Velcro: Coffee?
+Velcro: Juice?

]
Julia: Good morning.

She looks at Six expectingly.

Six bright: Met him.

He is willing to talk.

His name is Andrew Holmes.

Julia thought: Andrew Holmes...

+Julia: Ho...

+Julia: How strange.

Julia bleft: Velcro -

d: Velcro is gone already.

]
Velcro brings phone.

Six calls Andrew.

Setting a meeting in an hour at a diner nearby.

]
On the way Six notices there is NOTHING but boredom around here.

The diner reminds her of her home.

And childhood.

And Sunday mornings.

And the endless times she was punished and sent to wait outside diners just like this one.

Somewhere her father could watch over.

]
She snaps out of it when a man speaks her name.

There is a question in his voice, and something else, hope maybe.

Its Andrew.

Of course its him - she saw him enter.

Andrew bright: Six?

Six bleft: Yup.

]
She orders pancakes, tonnes of them, and eats them defiantly.

Andrew and Julia dance a delicate dance of reveling as little as possible.

She wants to know why a rich playboy does the things she heard he does.

He attributes it to the follies of youth.

She frowns like a suspicious aunt.

Eventually he has enough of this.

He got talent, he says.

Why not put it to good use?

]
Julia doesn't buy it, but leaves the subject.

With some regret she confesses he most probably will not be able to help them since he fights The Children while she seeks to help them.

He frowns, thinks, and eventually waves this off saying it will be alright. Julia is extremely pleased with herself.

Andrew surrenders and decides to put his cards on the table. He and Julia start to talk openly, planning plans and scheming schemes.


]
Six gets real tired with all this practical talk, and from this sad and terrible place of stupid little dreams, and stupid little heart brakes.

]
She goes outside, away from the important and the practical - and goes exploring.

She a young girl again, who just disobeyed her father and wondered off.

She doesn't even believe they are her real parent.

No one owns her.

No one can tell her what to do.

]
Its a boring place, this Canada. With boring people and their boring shit.

But she manages to find a brook. And she sits there for a while, with her toes in the water, till everything is better.

]
She goes back.

Playes with some kids in the street, near the diner.

At least they treat her as one of them.

]
She tries find Andrew's car, but when her eyes go over the parking lot she cant find anything suitable.

So she plays hopscotch, singing a little rhyme. Something about finding your sweetheart. And she thinks of Andrew.

She kicks the rock, letting it lead her.

]
Eventually it lands near a bush by a tree, under which she discovers a per of slippers.

Homey and comfortable.

She realizes it's some sort of fetish, so she examines it and discovers it's a sort of a sail.

]
when she returns her feet are filthy. She removed her shoes even before the brook. And the grownups are almost done. They wrap it up quickly and say goodbye.

She wants to talk to him but can't think of anything to say. Besides, it doesn't feel like the right time or place.

]
back in the safe house Julia tells her about the man Andrew caught and about the man from The Children that is handling him.

They are supposed to meet in a Turkish bath.

The rat faced man arrives first, and then his handler enters.

He doesn't know his name, but he should be there tonight.

]
Six bright: Should we go there?

Julia bleft: Maybe. If we just march in he will probably attack us before we open our mouths.

+Julia: And I rather avoid the commotion.

Six bright: So we should talk to him without him beeing able to tuch us.

+Six: Mirror maybe.

Julia bleft: Mirror might not be the best solution.

+Julia: He shouldn't be able to ignore us either.

Six bright: So we should bring him to us.

Julia bleft: That would be my preferred solution.

]
Six goes to check the place.

Velcro takes her and waits outside.

She thought they probably could use a pretty hostess in this fine establishment.

She was right.

But she must wait for the manager to get back from lunch. She can wait here or come back later.

She waits here. No one bothers her.

]
She soon discovers the room in which they meet and the benches upon which each of them seats.

She can trace their paths, each from his own door to his own seat.

There is a pattern here, in the arragment of elements around the space: The way the mirror reflects a specific passage, the delicate curve of a vase that sets the setting, establishing the dominance of the one over the other.

]
Six walks the paths again and again. She needs something to manipulate.

As she walks she fleshes out the behaviour of the dominant. Playing, toying with a hair growing from a mole on the side of his face.

Six thought: Damn hair.

He tears it out, as he get to his seat, and tosses it away.

It lends in the space between tow bars of the wooden bench.

]
Six thought: Here you are...

]
Six picks the hair up.

She will latter put this moll hair somewhere else, wherever they deside to somen him to.

Six thought: No I have to poar some meaning into this. 

+Six: Some emotion.

]
She looks at the rejected peace of him and fill compation for it.

He would fill it too.

A sense of longing to this small insegnificante thing.

A longing even.

And he would like to go and reunit with that.

And he will come with an open mind, and in a soften spirit.

]
She pick one of her eyelushes and put it space between the bars.

The link is set.

]
Six thought: So the portal is ready. Now I just need to make him jump...

d: she looks around.

Six thought: Well, its not like he is alone here, he's in a meeting.

+Six: someone should be setting here. Velcro maybe...

d: an image of a small screen with a count dowen flickers in her head.

Six though: The bomb obviously... what a better insentive to one of his hearataige...

]
This will be doen seaparetly, and anyway she should manage to convince Velcro to go along...

She looks around.

Six thought: I should make it posible for Velcro to leave just after the man will disapear.

She moves a curtien as she walks to the coridore 

Six thought: to go unnoticed.

She reaches the window, opens it, and climbs out.

Six thought: And get the fuck out.

]
Back in the she gives Velcro a huge smail.

Velcro bright: I don't like this smile.

+Velcro: what are you planing Six?

Six bleft: You'll need to be there.

Velcro bright: What?

+Velcro: Why?

+Velcro: Are you insane!?

]
At the safehouse Julia listens cerfully.

Julia bright: Very good. good instincts to use an eyelush too.

Velcro bleft: She wants to send me as the Hospitaler.

Six bright: Hi, I did take the procutious to get you out safely.

+Six: There this window-

Velcro bleft: Are you tring to get me killed?

Julia bright: No need for you to go Velcro. 

+Julia: Come down.

Julia bright: We can Send something else?

Six bleft: something?

]
The cast some sort of a spell. pailing thigs on the leaving-room floor, in a big empty squer.

Julia murmering.

Six followes her lead absentmindedly.

a creture is formed. and as the seramonny continus he bers more and more resemblanse to Landesmen.

It is a shdow creater, good enought to fool someone for a short while.

]
Six is not sure how the creture ends up in the hamm.

Nor she is very awer to Velcro and Julia leading her to the car,

And to a lonely wherehouse, 

Where a seating bunch been draged from ander some crates and put in the middle of the space.

Runes and pentagrams are drowen.

The moll hair placed cerfuly between the bunch bars.


]
She just waits 

]
drifting

]
She can Imagin him going through his door, walking farmely forward.

there is fog everywhere.

his fingers trace absently the moll on his face.

some filling creeps in as he sittes down.

As he looks at his date he rializes something is off.

Whit a small movment of his hand he spreads the misty curtain, and realize the setting was tamperd with.

And even before the shadow creture hands him the ipad with the countdown.

]
He is gone.

]
The air inside the wherehouse is sudenly filled with fog.

The Jupanies man standing there getting ready to fight.

He sees six

bright: *ANGLE!


]
He attacks. Misty fist.

Julia bright: Good evening. Let me intreduis myself:

Six waches it getting close and get hit in the chest. its stays in. 

Julia bright: my name is Julia.

She doing a muscle and pop it out to his direction. but colapses to nothing as she trys to manipulate it, and goes back to him

Julia bright: I usually don't deel with your people 

The Japanese and Six stearing at each other.

Julia bright: So you might never heard of me.

bleft: I know who you are.

+bleft: I am Last breath of man. 

]
Talk: 

First Julia ask Six to explain what she wants.
 
They constantly told her to be nice and apologetic so she does some of that.

Julia confess she belives they are right and offers to help by getting info from the Hospitalers.

He excepts.

six is off the hook.

]
back to Julias house. Six sleeps in the gazibo. 

card: the space under the bed

she dreams about Andrews meeting with Bedimus of the misons (Bedimus comes from the club where a battler gave him a note).

Its a well kept english like park, in the middel of a vast wild forst.

The met in a gazibo on a hill.

Andrew trys to convince the General he is on there side no matter what the truth is.

Bedimus saies nothing but he is very pleased Andrew revile Landesman.

She wakes up.

Keeps most the dream to herself.

She waits there whering obsinly short shorts and a loose endean looking blose.

He arives in a sport car, from the airpoet she asumes.

She is releved he didnt come with theslippers.

She climbs in.

+Andrew: So I gathere things turn out OK if you are wandering around.

Six bright: You could say so. But I'm known to be rekless.

Andrew bleft: You don't wont to talk about it.

Six bright: Not realy.

]
They ride in silance for some time.

He takes her into the city, and to a big old fasion building that ocupaies a full block.

a church maybe.

Six bright: Hanny, isn't it too soon?

Andrew bleft: humff..

]
A vole pops out and takes the car keys.

He takes her heand and walk her into a fancie, and rather empty holl.

A hostes is expecting them already.

bright: Mrs. Holmes, It's a pleasure to see you.

+bright: And with such a lovely companion.

+bright: How jealous I am.

]
While talking she leads them to an old-fasion elevator, and they rais up, probebly to one of the towers she have noticed from the out side.

The dark shady light of the elevator is scatered when the reaches there destany:

A spacius room, furneted with cofee table and a per of couches, and houge windows, greenhouse style that waches over the city.

Six looks out. 

The sun is still heigh but its almost blocked by twin towers, and only a thin fiery line between them marks its position.
  
Six bright: It's so beutyful.

The hostes runs to fetch thier drinks. 

Six sinks in one of the soft couches.

]
Six bright: So what is this place?

Andrew bleft: It's sort of a club.

Six bright: Of magicians?

Andrew bleft: No.

+Andrew:\nOf rich and sucssesful young men.

Six bright: Like a faternety house?

Andrew bleft: Exactly like a faternety house. 

Andrew:\nYou don't know the half of it.

Six bright: Including the silly and emberecing stuff?

Andrew bleft: Ha-ha.

Six bright: And you do thoes things?

Andrew bleft: I do have a reputation to maintain. 

Six gigles.

Andrew bleft: It's a mask you know...

Six bright: Yes, I guess I do.

+Six:\nAnd I'm not against the actions themselves, Its all about the meaning. The same dead could be empty or full with it.

Andrew bleft: I think its a good perspective for a magician.

]
The hostes rushes in with the drinks. A Sunset for him and a white russion for her.

bright: And what would you like to eat?

Six bleft: You don't have a menu.

bright: No.

Six bleft: And can you bring me anything I want?

bright: Prety much, yes.

Six bleft: WOW. It must be an outstending kitchen you got here.

Six bleft: I think I would like a stake. something with fat. but I rather have the meat more to the rar side, and the fat to its good side. and a coc.

+Six: Please.

The girl nodes and leaves them.

Six bleft: I like your life style.

+Six: Its so hard to get your stake just right.

Andrew bright: A well known hazerd.

]
Six bright: So tell me more about yourself. When did you become a magician?

Andrew bleft: Ho,I didnt stumble upon it, I come from an old blood line of power. aincient endian blood.

Six bright: And how old where you when its first manifisted?

Andrew bleft: Its hard for me to look at this that way. My grandmother noticed that. She was keeping an eye for that sort of a thing, 

+Andrew:\nSince my mother wasen't really in to her herategie,  

+Andrew: hans marrying a rich white man...

Andrew bleft: She thoth me much of the things I know.

]
more conversation: grnam dead, keeps good shape, visits some time.

Six ask of parents: father is a criple, mother taking care of him, not really intouch.

Andrew asks her of her family: tells she run away real early, heated the house, took some time till got to manheaten (rolled around for a while as Andrew sais.

Six ask about his hearitege: tells her of Sumossa - traible, african, endean. 

Six asks about Africa: tells her its a reall proble, fucjed by Maiisons, Xeletrx, and Maleus alike. would be paing more attention to  it if not the balagam.

Six sayes she having fun, he admits. saying she is nt like any model he have met. she mocs him for dating some stiupied modle she knows. anyway she is not even a human, or at least Julia saies so. He saies that surly as a modle she is trited as stiuped, she saies its onlya mask, or not even so, just a less relevent aspect of her. He saies he know of masks.

She asks him about the need to hold all thouse masks of his. he sayies its comes from an early age (maybe here grandma and shildhood)

She mantion the dream. He is not entierly happy with her dwelling ther. She mantion the batman theam, and that it seems to her he is persiuing that mithos. he saies it is his mithos, or at least his anssestorial mithos. She is pleased. About the dream connection she sayes its just the way it is, and she don't wont to tuch it. Some how she belives he relevent, to her.  

She tells of a the presens there, he thinks its a good saign. She tells of the flshe vison (landscape of light, light of infinity) he mantions its very responsibe of her not to aoutomaticly go check the thing she sensed and rather do it more carfully, she saies she is not as eresponsible as all make her to sound, just got a diffrent sanse of dangoure.

She makes fun about landing on Julias life and makeing a mass, Andrew saies more likely Julia hanted her then got hit by her. Six thinks its an interesting perspective.

] 
eventualy they leave, Andrew asks Six where to drop her, and she asks to go back by bus.
e 
Near the busstop he leans to kis her, but at the same time a mistic pact of bats hits him, marge into him, and he jurkes back, and saies he have to go.

She rides back happy and totaly inlove.

]
In the house Julia and Lucretia. Velcro be-DOM.

Anfer some interdation there is a on going argument, spiced with much AKITZOT.

Lucretia saies Julia cannot ignnor the entier family and treat them like kids, they are capable magiotions.

She blams Julia in undertending a small portian of the ansestorial will, which maight be a small erelevant part.

Julia saies its all she got, she keep saying it from time to time.

Six looks a bit on this conecttion: its a golden thred and the thigs around him a versatile and going to a very diffrent direction.

She asks Lucretia isn't its allwayes like this, with any hirogomy, and isn't it what there house is all about.

Lucretia saies that yes, but in a time like this more SHIKUL DAAT is requierd.

Six asks whats then the meaning of the connection if you wan't follow it, isn't it breaking ther line.

Lucretia saies she hope it won't get there but that they should check all options, Julia saies the name of the house goes with her

Lucretia asks six what she thinks, Six thinks they should check whats going on.Lucretia invites her to go meet the scavangers and sea what they know: very tens momnt. Six asks why lucretia wants her with her, Julia looking intently at Lucretia says she hears she is unique and hopes she get something extra. Six agrees.

Julia thinks no need to talk to others, they with the Children will act, and the rest of the world will join when it join and reavile its true affilations by act - not talks.

some anger about Julia been unflexible, this is the resone Nicolas considering joining exeletrix.

Julia crossed by the thought and saies he is to influanced by his cousin, and maybe becouse of that it could never work.

eventualy Six goes to bed.

]
dream. big natural Cave. Sumosa meeting. Andrew is there, bear chested. 

they do some suramony - a summoning of a sort.

some of the people kind of flicker and strach ocationally, like through some twisted mirror.

when of thoes people is a tall firce looking woman, she gets to Andrew, saies:

bright: Now be a good boy

hold him by the hair, tilet his head back till is mouth is open, and poar some liquied from a NOD she is holding.

More dance, exctasy, Andrew begans to strech and flicker too, and aventually all the others as well.

Six somehow in all this, and it is all building to some big climecs of elevaiting, thoese flickers that strach you between her and whatever it is or whomever it is they sumonning. 

And in the last second before the entier crowed is rising some how, Andrew turns and look at her, and they rais together.

]
Morning. Six is happy. goes talk to Velcro in the kitchen and then outside, for nice wheter.

Shy asks more of the Lucretia Julia relationship. 

He talks about Nicolas and himself, since for Lucretia he is taking Nicolases rightfull place, as for Julia Nicloas didnt fit. didn't work well with her, and she claims that with the ansoster either.

She asks of the scavangers, he tells her they gotter knolage, data, and scavange shit. 

Shy asks why Julia dont want her to go, he saies he thinks Julia dont want her to get to muche exposion.

Julia enters the kitchen eventualy bids them good luck,

Lucretia and Julia embraice warmely, and Six and Lucretia go.


In the car Lucretia and six convers, Six ask how they gona see - a big mover (?)

six brings the femaly thing, she talks about using Lucretias and Julias difarence to build something stronger instead of going against each other. She talks bothe metafisicly (yin-yang mathafor), she saies they could be more like a heart and heand, and talks about showing support, wich she didnt see Lucretia does ("or maybe you have she have showen support before I came, I dont know...)

Lucretia is tuched bythis, tears in her eyes, and she nodeds.

]
stop near a comics/game shope, bothe enetr. all geeks in place are having hard time brithing, the vendor is strok by the fuct that Lucretia shows with some chick how is even better looking.

Lucretia saies they come to a meeting, and they walk in to a back hole which filed with computer equipment and people how are working with it. most unusual layout.

Lucretia say six shoul find a place to sit till she arange things. apperentlly the meeting is not requiering them to be in the same location.

Six finds a hammock wived from wiers, climbs up, there is a keboard there and on the wall not far there is a screen.
I
she opens the computer, there is a login window with all sorts of optional params (like trip code), she fill her name: Six

]
In there is virtual reallity, she fills like she is inside, a figure shows, its Lucretias avater doen with Lego pices.

She say lets go but six wants a morrior, so she calls Mazikin.

Mazikin showes up,sayes she will help with my make-over and Lucretia leaves till I'll be ready to arrange the meeting.

Some small talk, some Lucretia is Xeletric, Mazi thinks, becouse some moduel she have.

Mazikin pulls a lever and a mirror is drown, Six looks like a sweet cartunish version of herself. Mazikin mantions some thing about a trip code and six saies then she use it from outside. Mazi get confused.

]
Six marges out, infront of the screen again looking at the log-in window, and triend to find her right code trip 

{card: fireplace}

she enters the code that will enable her to fill at home there. when she enters she is way above the store, wierd to the matrix, she easely zooms in and detachs herself from them.

she looks like lilu dalase+metrix cthoulu - very cool. Mazi goes Ho!

Mazi bright: I thought you are here for the first time
Six bright: I am
Mazi bright: So where did you get this trip code
Six bright: I've just made it
Mazi bright: what, ask someone to programer and rander it within a second?
Six bright: No, I just magic.
Mazi bright: ho, screw you.

]
six sike mazi a bit, saying she is an align, then no, then maybe is.

refuse to tell where the trip code is, or says she made it just now but mazi find it heard to belive her.

asks Mazi about the way she does magic. talks about seramonies, Mazie let her read part of a blog discrabing using magic suramony. talking about the position of the scavangers in the megical univers, they go scavabge, there for lols, information wants to be free. 

talking about where they get data: everywhere, dont have much history but are trading with everybody, learning as much as posibale.

talks about her project, the Malrove tree, enable using magix and feed-back to create a tool to genarate seramonies with highh success probability. six ask to see it, see the tree, saies she is interested to help her.

Mazi bright: Are you a programer
Six bright: No
Mazi bright: So how exactly?
Six bright: I am not sure yet.

exchange phones number, Six is openly and Mazi a bit shoked by this lack off awernace to the ciberspace, and discritly.

six off to Lucretia hwom she can fill.

] 
Lucretia infront of a house, Bobby's house. She explains a bit about him and conface she pland to use Six as a carrot, but after the talk would like to be open with her.

Six don't like the idea, she say she wants to work with them anyway, and she prefer the direct way.

Lucretia is unhappy by this but agrees.

]
Bobby looks very young, Six cant be sure if he is a teenager or a young man. He is blind.

Six bright:"Y R U blind in here?"
Bobby bright:"..."

Six wondering can't he change it, Bobby says that he don't think its possible, to pricy. He mention her Avatar is cool

bright Lucretia: I have come to you regarding tow diffrent metters. The first is to interduce you to this most fasenating young woman...

Bobby is trying to find What is so interesting about Six. six tells about the avatar, sayes she "does magic no rituals", bobby disbalives, checks the avater finds out it wasnt in the last backup, getting diturbed, recognaizing the signiture on the avater and sending a query to the guy supposedly did it.

(* bobby is supprised Lucretia just givs him option to work with Six no price tag attached).

Second thing- the war. where the scavangers tend, -they are neutral saies bobby, - where your bat is leaning - says he don't have enought info but if it's true he will see it as a personal responsibility to infor his fanatic followers.

Bobby gets a massage from the guy, how saies he didn't do it, or maybe he rememberd vaigly a disign... Bobby friks. He says he would love to attach some equipent to Six to find out how she works, it friks him, he says they should be more carful, that maybe Six shouldn't have come, that many will try to exploite her as a resorse. 

Six is upset by this, Lucretia trys to sude Bobby to no end. Then Six says its ok and she wants to leave. Bobby promisses to check about the children's exusations and, also deleting the avatar and covering trucks. He ergas Six to take is warning siriously and lay low. she promisses she takes him very sirously.

Tomso interegated by Julia, says its the time of end of all lies. Archivests are the real counsiul of the Hospitalers

bright Bobbie: It's so checks out.
bleft Lucretia: shut up you pranoid loonitic

boat metafor. not end of the warld, babilon - gives quatations from all around, prounsing haapily. Trys to talk with scavangers methaphores, and annoies them.

Six asks aout responsibility.

Thomaso ask for lock of hair or blood. All are filed with tention.
Six bright: No way. I can hardly take responsiblity for my own actions, ask anyone. I can't take responsibility for anyone else.
blef: So those, whithout even a GALGAL HTZALA the saved is throwen again in the water.

And he vanishes.

]
Six a bit worried she even said anything, Basiclly she thinks about Lucifers claim Jhova made the world and signed on it, The others say its not like this. She thinks either way most of the efort needs to be transforming the JIFA, she don't think it's enevedable.

Bobbie says its a bit of a GISHA TVUSTANIT, Jhove is only one myth and can  be fought. Six thinks its surlly will pass (children deffenetly gonna fight), but fighting is not the best of ways, transforming the blow into something else, riding it, is better. Julia agrees, and Bobbie eventualy agrees as well.

They all have ther things todo.

]
Julia takes Six to the side

Julia bright: The children are about to attack a hospitalers nest. wanna do something about this?

Six bleft: Nop.

Julia bright: Are you quite sure you are not the anti-criset?

Six bleft: Am I a tool of distraction?

Julia bright: No.

Six bleft: There you have it.

]
Six asks Velcro to land her his bike so she could go chack about the far coat that triggered herwakening. Velcro refuses to land it for he sure she will reck it topices, Instead he goes with her to meet Van-dike, the fashion designer. He is an annoing petty man, how saies its not the coat he have left for her, asks about the clothes she boarod from the show since he want to give it as a gift to his scorny boyfriend, calls Velcro handsome, calls her white tresh, asks her to wark for him in Dubie in exchange of telling her how where the drassing boys in the show that day.

They leave upset, Velcro wants to beat him up, but eventually is convinced he shouldn't (just in the moment when Six is convinced they could)

Off they go to meet the floor manager of the "13'th floor" - where the show took place.

]
Mona Sone, to whom Six refers as Mona Simona is a big woman, but very feminine.
She heres them out, shows interest, especially when Velcro suggest they check the video cameras.
She asks them to wait for an hour until she is ready, Velcro points out she wearing Samosa decorations/protection signs.

]
After an hour they meet again, Mona wants to know more, she asks if its magic. Ask what the coat does.
Velcro bright: it is King Solomon's hunting coat, it enables one to dream while awake.
They check the video she brought, and see a man coming in, checking is clock, counting the coat hangers, removing the coat Van-Dike made, and replacing it with the fur coat he pulls from beneath his jacket, then he goes.

Six and Velcro have no idea how he is. Mona says its her good luck charm. Apparently she sees him for many years, he usually vanishes when she comes closer but he is some how connected to her, she say he probably at the train station right now not far. Six wants to go.

]
The man is there when they go in, but in the other said of the rails. Six jumps and crosses, Simona shocked but fallows, Velcro goes around.
The man is looking at Simona
bright: hello angle
bleft:...
bright: may I kiss you?
bleft:...

His name is Vins, he doesn't want to spoil things to come, he is a ghost, from the future apparently since he claims to be Simona's husband. He is a Scavenger, and after death he found himself attach to his mama-su. Simona a bit shocked but intrigued. The coat he brought to enable Simona to come to him, took it from the children's place (the one Andrew attacked), put it in the right place by the ritual he did and voile.

Velecro bright: Why would the children do this?
Six bleft:?

]
shopping
SMS to Andrew

Six: I want SEX.

+Six: Real!

]
A black Batmobile sort of a car stops in front of the shop.

Six thought: How cool!

Six bright: Velcro dear, my ride is here, off I go.

Velcro bright: SACHTAIN ALICH ACHOTI.

]
Andrew takes Six to a quite little place in a park where there is no one and you have a nice view, a small creak is running there.

They have plenty of great SEX, the creak has more water there in the and. Six falls a sleep, Andrew takes her to his home, Shush Alfred a way, put her in bad and gets to sleep beside her.

]
morning, breakfast, some cheat-chat. Six feels Andrew is reluctant to tale about work related things, maybe he just wants to help her to keep other people's business their own.

She encourages him to share, he talks about tow things: the beg of nine winds he had for a short time and he knows little about (apparently the children have stole it back from the Hospitallers, along with the coat in last night hit).

Second thing is the Hirogamy he suppose to enter, which he doesn't want for it will complete will take over and change him, but on the other hand he is not sure if he can pass that much of a power in such a time.

]
Six wants to know more, he shows her using SEX ritual in which they share visions.

She sees the Samosa as the ant can see the boot, she changes perspective and rise to see it as the termite mound it is. Andrew becomes disturbingly submissive in this point, juices of sorts explodes in his mind in this point, then he shoves her head down and takes her to see something more particular, the termite that is the scorpion he suppose to Hirogamy with.

Then their bodies reach orgasm somewhere behind them, and they explode and get separated from them.

]
When six comes back to her senses she is in a cave of some sort, Andrew is there already up and pulled together, there is cricking and ticking sounds that are continuous, and much more aware of her then she if it.

bright: What Are you ding here
Six bleft: its a trip, we came to visit, but if you don't like it we can leave
Andrew bleft: I came to visit you on this side.
bright: It's not your side yet.
Andrew bleft: But that is the plan, isn't it?
bright: Plans are not of this realm. You can go now, but her I like to stay.

Andrew starts to say something but vanishes, The Scorpion/termite done something. Six not sure where he is, maybe is actually that shape not far from her and she simply can't quite reach him or fill him.

]
They talk, Ant not happy with Six, Six shows to little respect, Six don't respect her position which is andrew, six says to the and andrew is but one of many, the And dont get the point. Ant acusing Six shoving her fingers to Andrews privet holes which it already claimed for himself. ant thinks Six looking delisious and that maybe it needs to take her as well.

Six feels her body going numb.

She realizes she should fuck of and decides to rid out on the same sexual drive that brought her in.

The And is well prepared for this, coz Ant or no, this is Samosa thing, and the Ant have no physical body to slow her down.

But just before it might be to late, and because Six is to of a romantic to be Hirogamied to an Ant, Andrew shows up with his special glove and hits it. He grabs Six, put her in his car, and hellrides away.

They go through much scenery, Six covering her eyes, then they go through a church window and they are back at bad.

]
They dress and leave.

Andrew bright: Well, thanks for helping me make up my mind.

Six tell him quickly about JIFA & Thomaso (maybe here he asks about bag).

Andrew bright: Don't you think you should have told me you're the Antichrist BEFORE we went to bed

Six bleft: I'm not the Antichrist

Andrew bright: They all say that...

He drops here in the buss station, says he goes undercover.

Andrew bright: See you in my dreams

Six shakes her but good-bay, and off she goes in a bus surrounded by shopping bags and happy thoughts.

]
No one at Julia's. There is a text message from Velcro from last night asking if all OK, and a missed cal from Bobbie.

She texts Velcro

Six: all is OK, I'm back. Where are you?

Calls Bobbie. He says he played a bit and checked and they he don't think I'm the Antichrist and that they are positive towards me. Six talk to him about playing more, and going through the change, and the metaphor of seeing as one that will be good for him to except and work with.

Missed call from Velcro.
She calls, no answer.
Calls Bobbie to see if he knows what what - he doesn't

Checks mystically (but gently) around when and in what spirit they left - and get the impression they left few hours ago to do something that isn't considered by them to be dangerous or extreme.

]
Six takes stakes from fridge, does one for her and another cuts for puma and calls her to come.

It comes, eats but look somewhat uneasy.

Six bright: Something is wrong?

puma stands up

Six bright: You want me to follow you?

The puma starts running - six follows.

]
Near balcony, where elephant skin joins to rhino skin, in the border line, a pile of dead things. When she examines six sees that whatever goes there dies. She thinks about what to do when Velcro calls. She tries to ask Julia through him should she fixed this or leave it, since it's Julia's place, They come over.

Julia sees that and goes talk to dolphins.

Six bright:Wanna grab something to eat? I feel like burgers, texas style to much my outfit if posible.

Velcro bleft:Sure thing baby, If the smell of corpses build you appitate who am I to stand in your way

Six and Velcro goes eat burgers in a taxes burger place where she rides a mechanical bull, having much fun, and encouraging Velcro to explore more his extravagant side.

Bobbie calls

Bobbie bright: Completely followed you advice. Cool. I know what you are, at least by the Sabot. This is the Deluge and you are the Ark.

]
Talking more about this, ask about archivists post, Bobbie says he doesn't want to lose his reputation, Six wanders don't he have a different nick for this sort of things. Bobbie realizes the information is too important for ego and is shocked by his own shameful behaviour. He goes to fix that.

Velcro pleased to hear she isn't the Antichrist.

The go home, where she puts on a mini fashion show for and eventually with Velcro, who plays along nicely.

]
Lucretia comes, tells she didn't get much out of her meeting. The Sabot is an embarrassing matter, Six says Bobbie said they where cool, and Lucretia points that if Savot where something like the Scavengers its a good reason for Acceletrix to be ashame. She got a lead to someone.

She happy to here Six is not the Antichrist as well, she asks of her sister, then ask after the resone she is conversing with the dolphins, and runs of to the balcon.

]
Julia swims back. Says its strange, no decision about how or even should they do something. Its strikes her ood since the ancestor is a spirit of sort, and from what she saw she don't think that it can make the transition, as she cannot. But there is no fear from the ancestor side and she got the sens it does (the other side) make sens to it. She is uneasy.

She too is extremely pleased to know Six is not the Antichrist.

Asks about Lucretia. Not surprised to hear she run of to check things out in the balcon.

The converse some more about the metaphor of the Ark and the idea that Six can survive the transition.

They go to balcon again but only after a warning by Julia that Six won't do nothing but inspect.

]
In the balcon Lucretia sitting between the (increasing in size) heaps of corpses, shoving insects through the death wall.

Julia bright: You and your Acceletrix devices.

bleft Lucretia: better from you in some way I don't remember.

Six falls into mystic vision and sees both of the zones clearly. When a dragonfly passes through it's like being teleported into an occupied space - it's shadowside simply explodes.

Lucretia bright: Maybe we should bring Acceletrix here to inspect

Six bleft: what for? It's pretty self explanatory

Lucretia bright: Are you trying to tell me it makes sense to you?

Six bleft: Yep.

Lucretia bright: You look human, but there is nothing human about you, is there? You really are a complete alien.

Six bleft: I resent that.

Lucretia bright: You are looking at the most alien thing in creation and saying it looks familiar, how should I call you then?

Six bleft: ...

+Six:/nWell it's not such a big deal anyway.

Lucretia bright:What do you mean?

bleft Six:/nI mean I its good as a first scetch.

Lucretia bright:First scetch!?

Six bleft:Ho I don't know. 

Julia bright:Don't Bulshit us Six.

Six bleft:Well what do you want me to say? it freaks Lucretia.

+Six:/nFine, I could do that, Its not such a fine work, not a bad start though.

Julia bright:... 

+Julia:\nI'm going to head home a take some time to think it through.

]
Velcro confide in Six about his hasitation to ask Lucretia to talk to Karlos. Six encourg him to aproch her. She dont thinks Acceletrix is as problematix as Velcro and his family belives.

Velcro bleft:Lucretia, Why don't you talk to Karlos and see what he can tell us?

Lucretia bright:Did you ask her premission to talk to me?

Velcro bleft:....

Lucretia bright:What do you want me to say? That I don't trust my own son. Well - I don't are you happy?

Velcro bleft:....

Six bleft:Why don't you trust him? Becouse he is into Ecceletrix? I don't think it's a bad thing, just a thing, not bad.

Lucretia bright:So why won't you talk to him? You are a lovely young creature, and you are open minded to. talk to him.

]
Back in the house Six calls Karlos and set to meet him later on that day. He comes to pick her up in his car, he dose'nt get out to meet the family. He looks like an ARS, but got geeks eyes. He takes her to his place in some flat taower in Manheten.

]
They convers much. shy try to understend ecceletrix beter. Ecceletrix for him is a good way of using resources. He thinks regarding the spieits of the other relm as something more then a moceing caricatures of yours or grander subconciens is rediculase. Its like talking to yourself. He treats the other side with much fear - as a place that is constantly trys to whashbrain you, the earmuffs, as he regards the Ecceletrix tech, is a neccery block.

]
He says that for him its much more biutiful to see the magic in what e considerds to be its purest form, when its manifested in the relm of fenomena through the pisical lows.

When Six asks about Julia and Velcro its hard on him. He says he is past the regrating and bitternes part, allthough it took him much time. he said he was better, studied everything, knew everything, but they flanked him none the less giveing him no explanation but the one Six heard allready that he didn't fit. Julia scares him, and he think it was on purpes.

]
when Six asks about his opinion on the Scavangers he says they are wanna be sientists doing creepy past and meny other unholy things. Worst health plan ever, no extraxtion meens. when they go in they just trying to get out without ever knowing if they'll manage. some of them actualy dont. They do have there masses, which gives them much strength. For example he needs to experiment his thing on himself, if he had them he could be expereimenting on much more.

]
They talked about hirogamie for him, he says it would probably help him with his hobbie but not his work. and anyway he wont do it for it imidiatly will make him someone not trust wordy among the family, and by that to less valubale to Ecceletrix. right now he is in an ideal place where he could use both sides to boost his research, and when that will happen, he wont need the faivores of no one.

]
In some point Karlos takes some pills. Six wander what it is and Karlos explains its his experiment thing. Karlos explains it inhens your sences and anables one to better comunicate or understend shadow things. She wants to know a bit more and therfor checks him through her mistic vision.

When Six looks at Karlos she can see his body as if charged with lithnings, random sparks run over it.

She can see something else either. Some figure, an egg shaped head over long figure. A bit suprised she rialized its been around here for some time now, she have first noticed it in the kitchen, later on in the living room, and right now its stend in the coridor that run ibto the house.

Six bright:How are you?

Karlos bleft:I am Karlos. Remember?

Then Karloses eyes turn to the direction Six is looking to, and his entier body goes lighten when he sees the creature.

Karlos is a bit shocked, the creater is gone, and a unsettling bubling sound comes from a wall wich is covered with some wood panels.

Six bright:What was it? 

+Six:/nKarlos?

Karlos having some speach difficalties.

Karlos bleft:SlenderMan.

Six bright: And what is that sound?

Karlos bleft:Goo.

A fire starting to consume the wodden wall, and something else too. some black lighting storm haze.

Karlos manage to point to a closet from which the sound is obviously coming. Ecceletrix stuff she asumes.

]
Karlos gestures Six they should move, takes her heand and move with her as quickly as posible across the room and bihiend a sofa, where he crauches, pull Six down and starts smeshing the big window glass.

Six can see the SlenderMan reflection in the window glass. He is formed from the black haze and moving suiftly towerds them. in his hand some sort of a wepon - four crescent shaped blades on top of a rod.

]
Six makes a swiping gesture with her hand, gathering air and creating a shild wich will hit the SlenderMan as he trys to step throug it. As she finish her move she hears the window biheind her breakes, and this time, she realizes, it was not Karlos this time but the SlenderMan. 

Six files the road hit her lower back, and the blow through her forward, through her shild, which throughs her even farther to the other side of the room, where the fire is all but completly consumed the wooden wall.

The SlenderMan facing, as much as a faceless creature can face someone, Karlos which got knoced down. Karlos strech his hands forward and lightings jumps through devices on his rists, hitting the SlenderMan. A second later a long tantical shoots from the far side of the room snaching the rod from its hands. This move gets the SlenderMan by suprise, though it does not looked worried by the fact. 

The SlenderMan lifts a boany hand thowerd Karlos that got back up on his feet. Karlos press on some button on his bracer and turns into a bluery tornado as far as Six can tell. He suirl through the SlenderMan and when he stops the boany hand that was pointed at him looks severly damaged, broken. 

In that instant another tentacle is thrown at the SlenderMan, hitting it with its own weapon.

The SlenderMan cracks, more like a porcelain dolls
