Persephone and Hades, facing each other in profile, standing in a cave. He is grabing her for a kiss. She is crying. At their feet there is a puddle in which dead leaves are floating. They are reflected in the water.

Hades tearing Persephone's dress. It's his POV (maybe a bit higher), down his arm, from the bottom left corner, tearing at the center of the page. Her dress is living plants which shrivel and crumble under his touch.

Hades, horned crown / helmet and a royal cape, pinning her hands to the ground, sinking her into the leaves. The camera is over her right shoulder or something, looking level at him, face to torso that's on the ground or on her. He takes over the page, from top to bottom.
