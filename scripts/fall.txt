The opening to the underworld. Persephone is crying. At the bottom is a puddle in which dead leaves are floating. The couple are reflected in the water. Maybe, for to have less empty space, the frame will be tilted. Maybe the pool and reflection will only appear in the panel.

Hades tearing Persephone's dress (and at the center of the page). Her dress is living plants which shrivel and crumble under his touch. Should be a full body shot.

Chunga chunga. POV is from behind Hades, at the base of the panel, with Persephone riding him. Suddenly it is she who is sinking him into the leaves (so you can't see his throbbing LoL at all, Aya), clawing at his broad shoulders. Flowers probably appear here and there.

Chunga chunga. POV is from above and a bit behind Persephone, who is sitting on Hades, facing him, arched back. With one hand he is holding her's behind her back, forcing her to arch, but also supporting her. With his other hand is grabbing her head and hair, arching her even further. He is biting at her breast. Pain and pleasure.

Second unit director says that maybe this picture should be upside down, like the hanging man which is the card of this comic.

A bird's soul entering the underworld. It starts with a bird, sort of metamorphs halfway to a plant (G is crazy) and becomes a ghostlike schmektekle yanked into the underworld. Refined. Quintessentialized.

Second unit director is not sure about this last image. Maybe the flowers should have been there all along. Maybe not at all.
